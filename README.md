The main learning objective for this project was creating my first start-to-finish site using nodeJS on the back end. This included creating a skeleton website, using node as a web server, creating a database via mLab, displaying the data using forms via pug html templating, and deploying the finished product to heroku.

I ran into several issues throughout this project: 
* Formatting the lifespan of the authors to look like how I wanted was difficult. All I needed to work though this was making sure that moment was installed and to not use the same names (date_of_birth vs date_of_birth_formatted) for the schema names.
* Getting the genre detail page to display. I continue to run into a 404 error. Currently working on a fix for this one.
* Deploying to heroku. I am able to get a heroku app running, but pushing my files onto the heroku server seems to be causing issues.

Despite the issues that I ran into when working on this project, I have learned far more doing this tutorial about nodeJS than I have in the past. IUn sdf
