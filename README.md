# Programming 2 Final: twist


### TWIST FOLDER:

We formulated a website for TWIST (teen womanin science and technology). Through the backend, using what we learned from class about node.js, we were able to create th emodels, controllers, and routs to succesfully create the website. In the project we also had to impliment the CRUD functions (create, read, update, and delete) for each page. I also formulated some tables for our pressenter pages to hold the list of pressenters, as well as a formulate a table for the schedule page. Some of the issuess on the project were trying to get the picture to load on every page, the update and delete functions. I was able to step through the local library tutorial or find examples online when I got stuck with anything which helped solve a lot of my problems. If I was to start over I would put more of my attention into making sure the update and delete functions completly worked. Those two took the longest to formulate and figure out how to properly execute. 
We also had some problems with Github. Some issues such as pushing to the master brach. My compputer would give me an error when i tried to commit the code i worked on, so there was some difficulties comparing and getting our codes/edits back and forth.
